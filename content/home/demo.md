I've produced a variety of demos for myself in that regard.
Now I can affirm that I genuinely excel at data wrangling, modeling, and project evaluation on my own.
In actuality, I love to investigate and learn new theories for every project, even though it is exhausting and highly stressful since I want to help and demonstrate what I can also offer society.

[Check out the latest demo](https://academic-demo.netlify.app) of what you'll get in less than 10 minutes, or [view the showcase](https://wowchemy.com/user-stories/).
