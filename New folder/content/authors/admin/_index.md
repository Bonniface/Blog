To me, I like the chance to learn more about a topic that has a big impact on how we live our daily lives. I have a background in statistics and mathematics. I've learned web programming techniques as a final-year student, and  even launched a blog.  I was aware that there was something more I wanted to do, like construct anything in context to Ghana or Africa. I then reflected on my coursework, what I had learned so far, and which course I enjoyed the most. It was unquestionably "machine learning, model-related courses(Learn algebra, Logistic Regression), and statistical computing."
